<p><strong>About me</strong><br></p>
<p align="justify"><small>Hello, my name is Pratap Timilsina and I'm a data scientist and data engineer. 
	With over 6 plus years of experience in the field, I have developed a passion for extracting insights from data using statistical modeling and machine learning techniques. I have worked on a variety of projects throughout my career, including       predictive modeling, sentiment analysis, time-series forecasting, NLP, neural network and network analysis, among others.

In this portfolio, I have compiled some of my best work to showcase my skills and expertise in the field. You'll find a range of projects that highlight my ability     to analyze data, create visualizations, and build models that provide meaningful insights.

I am proficient in programming languages like Python, R, SQL, and Shell Script, and have experience working with Big Data technologies like Hadoop, Hive, and           Spark. Additionally, I have worked with tools like Tableau, PowerBI, and Google Analytics to provide valuable insights to stakeholders.

Thank you for taking the time to explore my portfolio. I hope that my work demonstrates my passion for data science and my ability to extract valuable insights        from complex data.
